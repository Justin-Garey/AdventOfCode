# Day 4

## Part 1

This one was fun. It reminded me of a more complex assignment I did in data structures while in University. I used a 2d array to map the warehouse and where the rolls of paper were. Then I looped over each position checking if there were any rolls of paper that could be removed. The total amount was counted up and returned. 

## Part 2

Using part 1, we just repeat the process until no more rolls can be removed. The total amount removed will then be reported.
