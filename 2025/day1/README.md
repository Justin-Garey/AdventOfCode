# Day 1: Secret Entrance

## Part 1

Part 1 started off with a warmup. All we had to do was loop over the input file and count the amount of times a line resulted in 0. 

## Part 2

I really struggled with this one. I made test cases and thought I had it, but I kept missing those pesky edge cases. Eventually I found a solution which was made simpler with the addition of counting the amount of 100s in an input before taking the modulo of the value. Then I was able to count passes of 0 and qualifying lines completing in 0.
